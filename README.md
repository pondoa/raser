# RASER

> Version 5.0 · Python 3.11 · Semiconductor-detector simulation

RASER (**RA**diation **SE**miconducto**R**) connects detector fields, particle
interactions, induced-current calculation, electronics, and experiment-level
workflows through one command-line interface.

## 🚀 Use RASER

After activating a prepared environment, use the public CLI:

```bash
raser --help
raser signal HPK-Si-PiN
```

Common workflows include:

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Solve an electric field | `raser field -cv HPK-Si-PiN` |
| Solve a weighting field | `raser field -wf HPK-Si-PiN` |
| Generate a signal | `raser signal HPK-Si-PiN` |
| Run a CCE study | `raser cce NJU-PiN` |
| Run a time-resolution study | `raser timeres NJU-PiN` |

Use `raser <command> --help` for the current options. Generated fields and runs
are stored under `work/`.
